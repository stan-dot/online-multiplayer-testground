pixi has more stars than phaser, and a dedicated React library!

### three js problematic
- original version is alright, 
- but react library doesn't work properly

and would need to learn Blender

TS tailwind seems alright for now, but would like to make WASM work in Nextjs

wasm-4 doesn't have the vibe I'm looking for

also no intellisense
